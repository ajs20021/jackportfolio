## The "Gossip Girl" in Popular Culture
  Films and television have made us all aware of the gossip girl stereotype. When we think of rumors, giving the cold shoulder, excluding people from friend groups, we subconsciously ascribe these qualities to young women. A long history of media has instilled this cliche leading us to believe that high schools are run by the popular girls whose conniving tactics keep everyone under their thumb. But it can't be that simple right? 
## Researching The "Gossip Girl" Stereotype
  Indeed, the gossip girl stereotype has interested psychologists. Researchers have explored gossip as its own behavior as well as a part of a bigger umbrella of related behaviors. This umbrella is called relational aggression, a non-physical form of aggression including interpersonal manipulation, sharing secrets, spreading rumors and, of course, gossipping.
  
  Previous research does find that relational aggression is higher in women compared to men (Archer et al. 2005). But why this is the case is not explored! Some researchers point to the nature of female friend groups compared to men. They suppose the smaller and closer social networks of female friend groups results in more peer influence compared to the larger networks that males tend to associate with (Kreager et al. 2011). But does relational aggression necessarily follow from that peer influence?

  This study will address the gaps outlined above, asking...
  
### Is relational aggression correlated with peer influence and does this relationship differ between men and women?

## My Approach
### Participants
- I used an open source dataset on the experiences of 723 North Carolina teens from different schools around the state. 
- They were 14 years old on average
- 327 male teens, and 396 female teens
- 223 were non-white and 500 were white

### Variables and Questionnaires
- Resistance to Peer Influence (RESPEER)
  -  This questionnaire assessed to what extent teens were resistant to peer influence. Higher scores indicate greater resistance (less prone) to peer influence (Steinberg & Monahan, 2007)
  -  
  -  Cronbach's _a_ = 0.794 (acceptable reliability)
  -  Factor Loadings = 0.337 - 0.677
  -  Example Question: A. Some people go along with their friends just to keep their friends happy. 
1 = A is really true for me, 2 = A is sort of true for me
B. Others refuse to go along with their friends, even if it makes those friends unhappy
3 = B is sort of true for me, 4 = B is really true for me


- Relational Aggression (RELAGG)
  -   In the dataset, this measure was compiled across questions assessing relationally aggressive problem behaviors (Multisite Violence Prevention Project, 2004)
  -   Cronbach's _a_ = 0.766 (acceptable reliability)
  -   Factor Loadings = 0.477 - 0.717
  -   Example Question: How many times in the last month have you tried to keep someone from liking another by saying mean things about them?
0 = never - 5 = 20 times
